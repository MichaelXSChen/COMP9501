\section{Evaluation}

We are going to evaluate the system using cluster tracing data from a real
production environment. The data set contains data over about a month-long
period. The data for the first three weeks are used for model training. The
fourth week's data are used for evaluation. 

In the simulation, requests are sent to the system, and the algorithm gives the
predicted number of requests at the end of this time interval. Resources are
deployed before the start of the next time interval. The duration of a time
interval should be longer than the deployment time.

The number of requests for each time-interval is collected and outputted with
different confidence ranges. The accuracy of the prediction will be evaluated
using several metrics.
